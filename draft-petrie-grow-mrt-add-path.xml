    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT)
		export format for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing information
		by extending it to support the Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP extensions.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
   Researchers and engineers often wish to analyze network behavior by
   studying routing protocol transactions and routing information base
   snapshots. To this end, the <xref target="RFC6396">MRT record format</xref> was developed to
   encapsulate, export, and archive this information in a standardized
   data representation.</t>
	<t>
	The <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths">Advertisement of Multiple Paths in BGP</xref>
	defines a BGP extension to allow the advertisement of multiple paths for the same address
	prefix without the new paths implicitly replacing any previous ones. The essence of the 
	extension is that each path is identified by a path identifier in addition to the addres prefix
	</t>
	<t>
	This memo documents an optional extension to the MRT format <xref target="RFC6396">RFC6396</xref>
	and introduces additional definitions of MRT Subtype fields to permit representation of
	Multiple Path advertisements
	</t>

    <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
	<section title="Rationale">
	<t>
	When a BGP message requires information about the capabilities
	negotiated during the setup of the BGP session for a parser to
	interpret the message, this information is carried by the MRT subtypes.
	</t>
	<t>The MRT specification defines the following BGP4MP subtypes:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE</t>
		<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4</t>
		<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_LOCAL</t>
		<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_LOCAL</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>
	These indicate to a parser whether the AS_PATH and AGGREGATOR attributes should
	be interpretted according to the rules in <xref target="RFC6793">RFC6793</xref>
	</t>
	<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths">Additional Paths in BGP</xref> alters the encoding
	of the BGP NLRI format for withdraws and announcements. Therefore new BGP4MP subtypes are required to
	signal to a parser how to parse the NLRI.</t>
	<t>The MRT specification defines the following TABLE_DUMP_V2 subtypes:
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>RIB_IPV4_UNICAST</t>
		<t>RIB_IPV4_MULTICAST</t>
		<t>RIB_IPV6_UNICAST</t>
		<t>RIB_IPV6_MULTICAST</t>
		<t>RIB_GENERIC</t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>The existing TABLE_DUMP_V2 AFI/SAFI-Specific RIB Subtypes specify that the Prefix Length
	and Prefix fields are encoded in the same manner as the BGP NLRI encoding. These also require new
	subtypes to retain the path identifier information in Additional Paths.</t>
	<t>The TABLE_DUMP_V2 RIB_GENERIC subtype contains a single raw NLRI entry, the encoding of which
	is defined by the AFI and SAFI. Additional Paths alter the NLRI encoding. Therefore a new subtype is
	required to indicate the change in NLRI format.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="MRT Subtypes for Type BGP4MP">
	<t>This document defines the following new Subtypes:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AP</t>
	<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_AP</t>
	<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_LOCAL_AP</t>
	<t>BGP4MP_MESSAGE_AS4_LOCAL_AP</t>
	</list></t>
	<t>
	The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent non-additional-path versions
	specified in <xref target="RFC6396">RFC 6396</xref>,
	and continues to encapsulate the entire BGP message in the BGP Message field.
	</t>
	</section>

	<section title="MRT Subtypes for Type TABLE_DUMP_V2">
	<t>This document defines the following new Subtypes:
	<list style="symbols">
	<t>RIB_IPV4_UNICAST_AP</t>
	<t>RIB_IPV4_MULTICAST_AP</t>
	<t>RIB_IPV6_UNICAST_AP</t>
	<t>RIB_IPV6_MULTICAST_AP</t>
	<t>RIB_GENERIC_AP</t>
	</list></t>
	<t>
	The fields of these message types are identical to the equivalent non-additional-path versions
	specified in <xref target="RFC6396">RFC 6396</xref>. However, for the specific case of the 4
	AFI/SAFI specific RIB Subtypes, the existing RIB Entries field is re-defined
	as detailed in the sections below.
	</t>
	<section title="AFI/SAFI specific RIB Subtypes">
	<t>In order to preserve the record compaction achieved by using the most
	common subtypes, and allowing multiple RIB entries to be stored in a single
	TABLE_DUMP_V2 record, the existing RIB Entries field is redefined for use
	within the new AFI/SAFI specific RIB Subtypes defined by this document as follows:

	<t>This adds a field to the RIB Entries record, to store the Path Identifier, when used with the

	<t>An organisation which uses the MRT format to store their BGP routing information should be aware that supporting
	these extensions permits more detailed network path information to be stored, and should consider the implications
	of this within their environment</t>
	<t>An network that peers with public BGP collectors, and enable the additional-paths capability on a
